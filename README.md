# Whapp-Deltachat
Whapp-Deltachat is a bridge between WhatsApp and [Deltachat](https://delta.chat). It uses
[go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp) and
[go-deltachat](https://github.com/hugot/go-deltachat) respectively to map verified
deltachat groups to whatsapp conversations. It is currently not full-featured and most
likely is ridden with bugs, but pretty usable. Use at your own risk ðŸ¤“.

## Requirements
- __A system that go-deltachat will run on.__ It should work on all systems that are supported
  by golang and libdeltachat, but the static object file that is distributed with
  go-deltachat has been compiled on an amd64 linux system, so for other architectures you
  will need to compile the lib yourself.
- __An Android or iOS device that is capable of running the WhatsApp mobile app.__
  go-whatsapp uses the WhatsApp Web API, so when you use this bridge you will still need
  to have a device that is running WhatsApp somewhere.

## Install
There are no stable releases as of yet, so the only installation method right now is just
installing from source.

Installation example:
```bash
# clone
git clone git@github.com:hugot/whapp-deltachat.git

# build
cd ./whapp-deltachat
go build .

cp ./config.yml.example ./config.yml

# Now edit the config.yml file
"$EDITOR" ./config.yml

# Finally, run the program.
./whapp-deltachat ./config.yml

```

## First run
During the first time the program runs, there are two QR codes that need to be scanned:
First, the program will print a QR code to stdout. Scan this QR code from your deltachat
client to become a verified contact of the bridge. The bridge will then create a verified
chat with you and send you a QR code to scan from your WhatsApp mobile app. When you have
done this, the bridge will start doing it's thing.

### Known bug during first run
The first time that the bridge runs it will receive a lot of messages at the same time and
not in chronological order. This means that pre-existing WhatsApp messages will not be in
chronological order when they appear in your deltachat client. New messages received while
the bridge is running __will__ of course arrive in chronological order.
